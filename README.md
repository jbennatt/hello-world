# hello-world

I originally studied physics but, at the same time, did a lot of programming. In fact during my physics courses, I routinely wrote Java programs to help me solve some of my physics and math problems. I later taught Calculus AP/AB, Pre-Cal, and Geometry at Churchill high school in San Antonio. After a couple of years I studied at UTSA to get a Computer Science degree. I graduated with a MS in Computer Science. I have since moved to Victoria, TX to be closer to family which, unfortunately, means I don't have access to many software engineering opportunities. I am currently teaching a Technology course at a local Junior High and am actively seeking employment in the field of software engineering. I am willing to relocate.
